1. BDB cannot support multi-user access by default
   see http://www.opencobol.org/archive/204.txt

   In order to support multi-user access BDB, you need to activate BDB concurrency.
   This is done by setting/exporting the environment variable "DB_HOME" to a directory that is read/writable for all users that should be able to access the files.
