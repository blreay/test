INTRODUCTION
------------
 
This communication verification sample is based on two CICS C application programs
which are designed to be used to test whether basic CICS ISC functionality works
using a configured communication definition between any two given CICS
servers.  The code has been designed to use common source to run on any
given CICS platform. 
 
OVERVIEW
---------
You should have configured communication between two regions before using
this sample. For more information on how to configure communication 
between two regions refer to "Communicating" topic in the TXSeries infocenter.

The Front End program CICSPING should be called by the CICS transaction
PING and will perform Function Shipping, Distributed Program Link,
Asynchronous Processing, and Distributed Transaction Programming to the
back end program CICSPONG.  The front end CICSPING will check
invocation and details of the communication definition and then perform
the tests in four steps, each of which can be invoked separately if
required.
 
All handleable errors and status messages are reported to the user's
terminal using native 3270 SEND TEXT commands and are also written to
the CICS CSMT log.  Any DTP state errors are reported and the
transaction will immediately terminate with the CICS abend code STAT.
Most CICS ISC errors should produce the SYSIDERR or TERMERR conditions
and these will be handled and reported to the user. The SYSIDERR
condition will cause termination of the test since it usually reports a
fatal problem.  Some CICS ISC errors may result in the ATNI abend code,
these are not handled and so the program will abend.
 
The back end CICSPONG has logic to tell which invocation mode was used
to start it and this is reported to the CICS CSMT log along with any
DTP errors detected.
 
All messages have time stamps and unique 3 digit numbers as follows:
 
     Enn -  indicates an error
     Pnn -  indicates a status message from CICSPING
     Qnn -  indicates a status message from CICSPONG
 
The PING transaction takes input directly from the screen along with
the tranid and so the given SYSID and test number need to be entered
along with the tranid.  The parsing of the input is limited and the
SYSID field must contain 4 characters and the test number 1 character.
If the SYSID field is the name of the local SYSID or is left blank then
the test will still run but in local mode although no DTP will be
possible and thus will not be attempted.  This is very useful for
checking the setup on the local system.

These programs can be used to verify the communication using different
connection type i.e. cics_tcp, ppc_tcp, local_sna and ppc_gateway.

SETUP
-----
Translate and comple the source using the cicstcl utility,
i.e. "cicstcl -lC -de cicsping" or the provided Makefile.
Then move the executables cicsping and cicspong to your
/var/cics_regions/<region>/bin directory.

Add transaction defintions for PING in the front-end region and PONG in
the back-end region and program definitions for CICSPING in the front-end
region and CICSPONG in the back-end region to the permanent and runtime
databases. If you want to verify the communication from either region
add these transaction defintions and program definitions in the both the
regions as follows:

 cicsadd -r <region> -c td -B PING ProgName=CICSPING
 cicsadd -r <region> -c td -B PONG RSLKey=public ProgName=CICSPONG IsBackEndDTP=yes
 cicsadd -r <region> -c pd -B CICSPING RSLKey=public PathName=cicsping
 cicsadd -r <region> -c pd -B CICSPONG RSLKey=public PathName=cicspong

Other RSL security attributes can be used but these should get you working.
Then away you go.

 
 
SYNTAX
------
Connect to the front-end terminal and issue the PING transaction as follows:
 
PING <sysid> <test>
 
 where
 
 <sysid> is a 4 character CICS SYSID
 <test>  is a one character number
 
 At least one of the options must be given as input to PING.
 
Syntax examples:
 
     PING ISC1     - run all tests to ISC1
     PING ISC1 1   - run only test 1 (FS TS) to ISC1
     PING ISC1 2   - run only test 2 (DPL) to ISC1
     PING ISC1 3   - run only test 3 (AP) to ISC1
     PING ISC1 4   - run only test 4 (DTP) to ISC1
     PING 2        - run test 2 without ISC option
